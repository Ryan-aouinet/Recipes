        <li>
            <strong>Make the Date paste:</strong>
            <em>  Place the pitted dates in a bowl. Pour the boiling water over them and add the baking soda.
                  Stir well and let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to a few hours,
                 to soften the dates.  The mixture will become a thick paste.  You can blend it with an immersion
                  blender or food processor for a smoother texture if desired.

            <em>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour
                 a 9x13 inch baking pan (or a round 9-inch cake pan). You can also
                 line the pan with parchment paper for easier removal.
            </em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cream Butter and Sugar</strong>
            <em>
                In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter (or oil) and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
                 Beat in the molasses and vanilla extract.

        <li>
            <strong>Combine Wet and Dry:</strong>
            <em> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just 
                combined. Do not overmix.
            </em>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong>
            <em>
                Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick 
                inserted into the center comes out clean.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool:</strong>
            <em>
