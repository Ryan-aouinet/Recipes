    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Authentic Napoletano Pizza</strong> <em>Is a culinary masterpiece with a few key characteristics:   

        Simple, High-Quality Ingredients: It's made with just a few fresh ingredients: flour, water, yeast, salt, San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and olive oil.
        
        Unique Dough: The dough is made with a special type of flour ("00" flour) and is often left to ferment for a long time, resulting in a soft, chewy crust with a slightly crispy exterior.   
        
        Hand-Stretched: The dough is stretched by hand, not rolled, which helps to preserve the air in the dough and create a light and airy crust.   
        
        Wood-Fired Oven: It's cooked in a wood-fired oven at a very high temperature (around 900°F) for a very short time (60-90 seconds). This gives the pizza its signature charred spots and slightly smoky flavor.   
        
        Thin Center, Puffy Crust: The center of the pizza is thin and soft, while the edge (cornicione) is puffy and slightly chewy.   
        
        Wet in the Middle: Due to the thin center and fresh ingredients, Neapolitan pizza is often a bit wet in the middle. This is part of its charm and is why it's traditionally eaten with a fork and knife.   
        
        Classic Toppings: The most traditional toppings are tomato, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil (Margherita) or just tomato, garlic, oregano, and olive oil (Marinara).   
        
        Overall, authentic Neapolitan pizza is a delicious and unique culinary experience that's all about the quality of the ingredients and the traditional cooking methods. </em>

        <h3>Step by step Instructions</h3>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li id="pizza-1">
        <strong> Activate the Yeast:</strong> <em>In a small bowl, combine the lukewarm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-2"><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> <em>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Pour the yeast mixture into the flour and mix with a spoon or your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-3">
            <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> 
            <em>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should become smooth and elastic. If using a stand mixer, knead with the dough hook for about 8-10 minutes.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-4">
            <strong>First Rise (Bulk Fermentation):</strong> 
            <em>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 2-4 hours, or until doubled in size. This is called bulk fermentation and is crucial for flavor development.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-5">
            <strong>Divide and Shape the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently and divide it into 2-3 equal portions. Gently shape each portion into a ball.
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-6"><strong>Second Rise (Proofing):</strong> 
            <em>Place the dough balls on a lightly floured surface or in individual proofing containers. Cover and let them rise for another 1-2 hours. This second rise is called proofing and allows the dough to further develop its flavor and texture.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-7"><strong>Prepare the Toppings:</strong> 
            <em>While the dough is proofing, prepare your toppings. Crush or puree the San Marzano tomatoes and season with a pinch of salt. Slice the mozzarella into thin pieces or tear it into chunks.  Prepare your pepperoni.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-8"><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong>
            <em> Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, ideally 450-500°F (232-260°C) or higher. If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven while preheating.  A wood-fired oven is ideal for Neapolitan pizza, but a regular oven can work too.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-9"><strong>Shape the Pizza:</strong>
            <em> On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch or pat out one dough ball into a round shape, leaving a slightly thicker edge (cornicione). Avoid using a rolling pin, as it can deflate the dough.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-10"><strong>Top the Pizza:</strong>
            <em>  Spoon a thin layer of tomato sauce onto the pizza base, leaving a small border. Add the mozzarella, pepperoni (if using), and a few fresh basil leaves.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-11"><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
            <em> Transfer the pizza to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet in your oven.  If using a pizza peel, dust it with flour or semolina to prevent sticking. Bake for 5-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.  Keep a close eye on it as it cooks quickly at high temperatures.</em>
        </li>
        <li id="pizza-12"><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong>
            <em>
                 Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Add a few more fresh basil leaves. Slice and serve immediately.
            </em>
